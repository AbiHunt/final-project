# Animal Crossing Project
### Final project for QA Coding Bootcamp

**What were my aims for this project?** <br />
> - My goal was to create a RESTful API using Spring Boot. <br />
> - The app's purpose is to store persistent data about Animal Crossing characters in a database.<br />
> - The user should be able to view the character's data.<br />
> - They should be able create, update, and delete character data.<br />
> - I needed means to make API calls through Postman (HTTP requests/responses).<br />


**How did I expect this project to go?**
> I expected to struggle with my time management this week without structured learning.<br />
> But what I acually struggled with most was version control and database management.

**What went well?**
>I managed mt time this week effectively and remained motivated to focus on my project.<br />
>Asking for help even though I was embarrassed to need guidance with some simple elements of the task. <br />
>I built a basic API which runs, despite finding the project very challenging. <br />

**What didn't go so well?**
>How long it took for me to get my app to run - unfortunately I had some trouble getting it working at first. <br />
>Using GITHub and Jira effectively was challenging.<br />
>I didn't complete as much of the task list as I'd have like to. <br />

**What could I improve?**
>I was slow in my process of getting my basic project running, so given more time I would like some other features added to my app.<br />
>For example, custom queries or implementing Mockito. <br />
